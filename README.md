# GeoReminder

Set up reminders tied to different geo-locations

## Background

There are many task management and reminder applications that are aggregated and sorted according to time.

GeoReminder allows users to associated these reminders to physical locations. Users are able to
set reminders for themselves or friends, so they are prompted when they enter or leave
certain locations. For example, you can set up a GeoPrompt to notify yourself to do laundry when
you return home.
